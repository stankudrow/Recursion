from functools import wraps


# Input:
#   * the source (src) rod with N items/disks;
#   * the target/destination (dst) rod to move the disks/items onto;
#   * the auxiliary/temporary (tmp) rod as a helper peg.
#
# The sequence is read from the left (bottom) to the right (top)
# and the disks/items are enumerated in the above order from N to 1.
#
# The idea of the algorithm is as follows:
#   * move N - 1 disks from the source rod to the auxiliary one;
#   * move the remaining item/disk from the source to the dest;
#   * move the remaining N - 1 disks from `tmp` to `dst` - a subtask.
