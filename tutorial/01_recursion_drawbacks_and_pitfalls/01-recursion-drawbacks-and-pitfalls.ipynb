If not, you can also do the same, but then study this topic at your leisure, and you don’t have to delve into mathematical analysis (it won’t be here), but it’s very worth getting the basic idea. This topic is often discussed as it relates to measuring the performance of algorithms - how to evaluate their effectiveness depending on the software and hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function/algorithm `constant_time` takes a sequence (as intended so) and no matter what size of an input sequence is, either empty or with a n-llion items, it will always take either three steps/instructions/statements (in the first case) or two (in another one). So the algorithm does not care about the size of the input data, its time-complexity is constant and (memory) space complexity as well since no extra memory allocations occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same goes for the function/algorithm `constant_space`: regardless of the input data, it returns a list of three numbers `[1, 2, 3]`. This takes up memory, but the size of the output data is not determined by the input data, and therefore the algorithm/function is considered constant in space complexity. It has the constant time complexity as well - only one return statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such functions are denoted as `O(1)` where `1` is a symbol of constancy. This is a convention to denote functions with constant complexities in constant this way, and not like `O(C)` for not (probably) putting the meaning of variability into the symbol `C` and not measuring functions of this kind by the number of steps or something like that - in the asymptotic sense (for now we use \"asynptotic\" word without delving into the meaning) they are all about the same thing."

This means that the execution of the algorithm already depends on the size of the input data, but this dependence is linear, in other words, `n` is included as is to the power of 1 and only 1. A prime example is the linear function `f(n) = k * n + b`, where `k` and `b` are constants. This function varies when `n` variable changes, the constant values do not impact . The constants can be large numbers, but they only give a constant correction and still the function depends only on the input variable `n` and is asymptotically (when the `n` tends to infinity) determined only by this input variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. for these functions there is a best-case scenario: when the input sequence is empty, no work needs to be done and the answer is given as is and with `O(1)` complexity;\n",
    "2. in the worst-case branch, all elements of the sequence have to be traversed with no escape from it;\n",
    "\n",
    "And now the essence: the complexity is determined with the size of the input. An example on the notorious linear function `f(n) = k * n + b`. If `n + m`, then `f(n + m) = k * (n + m) + b = (k * n + b) + m * k = f(n) + C(m)`. The in- or decrement of the function complexity is not constant anymore: it is detemined with `m` term with the coefficient of linearity `k`. So the `C(m)` term also exhibits the linear nature and this is the cost of changing the input in size. In the previous examples, this means the following: **adding `m` element(s) to the original sequence of size `n` will entail `m` iteration(s) each resulting in `k` complexity cost. Constant overhead is not of interest, it is already built into the original function `f(n)`."
